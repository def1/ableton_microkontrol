Ableton 8 - Korg Microkontrol Driver
====================================

These scripts were originally shipped with the Akai APC-40 and modified by Will Crossland
to make it work with the Korg Microkontrol. 

Despite the Korg Microkontrol is still one of the best keyboard kontroller available these days.
It's not just beautiful but the layout of the knobs and sliders are just perfect.

Unfortunately, the native Ableton support won't handle it's capabilities.

This collection of Python Scripts will take the native Ableton support a step further;
the current instrument's parameters will be displayed on the Korg Microkontrol's LCD panels
correctly, your drumpad will help you to switch between tracks and devices, and you can use
the middle buttons as a send interface. All the knobs/sliders will be dynamically mapped
to the current instrument.

The provided scripts will work with Ableton 8.

For installation please read the docs/wacKMK_Ableton_Control_Surface_Manual.pdf
